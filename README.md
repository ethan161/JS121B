This is a very simple discord bot - one that takes a pretty incredible amount of time, but one that works amazingly!

Type "Hello!" in chat to receive a reply from the bot, and type "Math" to have a randomized division problem be solved in the chat bar.

In the discordbot.js file, I placed my own code. I spent around three hours trying to set up the bot, so I didn't leave myself much time to add additional features.
Additionally, since this was posted to the internet, I changed the client token, meaning no one else can affect the bot.

I am already looking forward to adding features to this!
